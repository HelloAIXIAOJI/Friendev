Feat todo
- **Add todo management tools and command**
  - Implement `todo_write` and `todo_read` tools for AI task management
  - Add `/todo` command for users to view current task list
  - Support status visualization (pending, in_progress, completed)

Feat MCP
Features:  
- Deep MCP Tool Integration  
  - Dynamic Tool Discovery: Friendev can now automatically discover and register all tools provided by connected MCP servers.  
  - Namespace Isolation: To prevent naming conflicts, MCP tools are automatically named in the format server/tool.  
  - AI-Native Support: AI assistants can now "see" and directly call these MCP tools to complete tasks without manual intervention.  
- Resource Access System (Resources)  
  - Resource List: Added the mcp_resource_list tool to view all available resources.  
  - Resource Reading: Added the mcp_resource_read tool to support reading the content of resource URIs.  
- Interactive Prompt System  
  - Command: Added the /prompt interactive command.  
  - Workflow: Implemented a 5-step fully automated workflow: Select Server → Select Prompt → Fill Input Parameters → Execute Prompt → Automatically Send Results to AI.  
- Added the /mcp Command  

Improvements:  
- API Execution Layer Refactoring  
  - Implemented execute_tool_calls_with_mcp, bridging the complete pipeline from AI decision-making to MCP tool execution.  
- MCP configuration files are now uniformly stored in Friendev's standard configuration directory instead of the MCPCS directory.
